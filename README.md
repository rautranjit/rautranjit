<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p align="justify">Hi, I'm Ranjit Raut. I'm from Nepal. I've been interested in science and technology since I was young, and I'm always looking for new ways to learn more about it. My goal is to create projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with technology and its potential to make the world a better place. I'm currently working on several projects that aim to use technology to help people in need. In my free time, I like to explore new technologies and develop applications that will impact people's lives. When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me playing indoor and outdoor games or exploring the world around me.</p>
